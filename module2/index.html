			<h4>Dogs</h4>
			<p>The dog is a member of the genus Canis, which forms part of the wolf-like canids, and is the most widely abundant terrestrial carnivore. The dog and the extant gray wolf are sister taxa as modern wolves are not closely related to the wolves that were first domesticated, which implies that the direct ancestor of the dog is extinct.</p>

			<h4>Cats</h4>
			<p>Cats have flexible bodies and teeth adapted for hunting small animals such as mice and rats. A group of cats is called a clowder, a male cat is called a tom, a female cat is called a molly or queen while young cats are called kittens. ... On average cats live for around 12 to 15 years</p>

			<h4>Birds</h4>
			<p>Birds are vertebrates (animals with backbones) with wings and feathers. ... But a few bird species do not have strong enough wings to fly, and so these birds are flightless. Birds' bodies are covered with a light, tough layer of feathers and they have very light skeletons.</p>
